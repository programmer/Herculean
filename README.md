## Functionality and Usage
The raytracer currently supports 1920 x 1028 screens in unix shells. It uses ANSI escape sequences to render objects in color. Inspired from "Computer Graphics from Scratch" by Gabriel Gambetta. It currently supports: 
```
Simple raytracing
The render of multiple spheres
Point lights
Full RGB support for objects
A canvas size of 251x251 artificial pixels for supported screens
```

## Todo
```
A wide range of geometric objects
Other types of light (e.x. directional) & colored lights
Shadows
Reflections
Camera movement (i.e. transformation on the Z axis)
Embeddable language support (e.x. lua)
Port doom :0
```
